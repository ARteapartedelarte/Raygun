# Changelog

## 1.2.0 Render System Cleanup

- Remove experimental headless mode
- Replace reference OpenAL implementation with OpenAL Soft

## 1.1.0 Linux Support

The biggest change in this version is the migration from Visual Studio solutions to CMake.

With this change, Raygun can now be built on Linux.
Small adjustments were made to the code in order to fully support Linux.

- Use different application icon colour depending on build type
- Fix uninitialised data arrays in profiler
- Fix Vulkan resources use-after-free bug on engine shutdown
- Improve handling of window resize events

## 1.0.0 Initial Release

This is the first public release of Raygun. ðŸŽ‰

While there is still more clean-up to be done, the overall architecture is not going to change much in the near future.
At this moment Windows is the only supported platform.
Our plan for version *1.1* is to switch form Visual Studio solutions to CMake and support Linux as well.

In addition to this, some parts of the render system are not yet properly synchronised.
So far we did not encounter any issues on our test systems, but we plan to fix missing synchronisation in version *1.2*.

Please see the related issues for more information.
